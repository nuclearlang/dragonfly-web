# Contributing to dragonfly-web

Thank you for helping. This repository is part of [NuclearLang](https://github.com/nuclearlang): the language is the
[nuclear](https://github.com/nuclearlang/nuclear) repository, and the other repositories live as folders inside a clone of it, each with its
own git (the tools find each other that way).

## Set up

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nuclearlang/nuclear && cd nuclear
git clone https://github.com/nuclearlang/dragonfly-web
./install.sh
```

## Before a pull request

```sh
(cd .. && cargo test)                 # the example, the golden
sh tools/react-check/check.sh         # tsc --strict, the tests, vite build
```

- Everything is written in English: code, comments, docs and messages.
- A change that the user of NuclearLang can see updates its documentation in the same pull request (the spec of
  the area, the guide, `docs/context/` for agents and contributors).
- Rules and the reasons behind them: the [nuclear repository's AGENTS.md](https://github.com/nuclearlang/nuclear/blob/main/AGENTS.md) and its
  [decision records](https://github.com/nuclearlang/nuclear/tree/main/docs/adr).
